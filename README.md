# Creating an Animated Plot using Matplotlib

![SL vs Aus - Animated Plot - with Music](https://github.com/pranathlcp/matplotlib-animated-plot/assets/13727308/9f03c58e-c058-487e-8802-ac9848fe5bc6)

## Description

This is a simple jupyter notebook that attempts to create and customize an animated plot using matplotlib library. The sample dataset was sourced from the in-game win probabilities generated by one of the models that power the web application at http://predictors.shinyapps.io/wpsg/. You may change the dataset fields and the plot parameters to customize the plot according to your requirements. 

## Getting Started

It is advisable to use the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for setting up the Jupyter Notebook Interface and Python. More information regarding the process of setting up the environment can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html).

## Execution
Open the Jupyter Notebook interface in the source folder of the notebook, and open `animated_plot.ipynb`. Run each cell of the notebook sequentially to get the expected result. You might have to install more dependencies using a package manager such as [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) during this process.
